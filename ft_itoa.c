	/*Below we are saying if the int n passed in our paramter is greater than
	 * 10 that we want to break it down recursively so we can build it back
	 * up as a string. We do this by setting our memory allocated string str
	 * equal to our previously made ft_strjoin function and pass it the
	 * parameter of our ft_itoa function with n divided by 10 and our ft_itoa
	 * function with n modulus 10. This is where the idea of how recursion 
	 * works can be hard to understand. This use of ft_strjoin will not happen 
	 * until later because we are calling ft_itoa again. This will divide our
	 * given int by 10 and take the result and start the function over again,
	 * consitently breaking it down until we have the very first number in our
	 * int. For example if we started with the number n = 123 our call of
	 * ft_itoa(n / 10) and ft_itoa(n % 10) is really ft_itoa(123 / 10) and
	 * ft_itoa(123 % 10). This will call ft_itoa on a value of 12 for the
	 * division by 10 and call ft_itoa on the value of 3 for our modulus 10.
	 * This is how we break down the number into individual digits. For our
	 * result of 3 it will begin this function over again and skip this section
	 * since it will now be a value that is less than 10. We see in our next 
	 * else if statment that if the number is greater than 0 and less than 10
	 * we convert it here into an indiviual string that would be "3\0" because
	 * we must have a terminating '\0'. This individual string will be
	 * returned to the ft_strjoin function it was called in to be joined
	 * with the string that will be return from its fellow parameter. But what
	 * has happened to the ft_itoa(123 / 10)? Well that has given us the number
	 * 12 to put into this ft_itoa function. Since this number is still greater
	 * than 10 we will the if statement that will use ft_strjoin with the
	 * two ft_itoa functions passed into it's paramters, but this time on the
	 * value of 12. As has happened earlier with the full value of 123 we will
	 * be splitting this 12 now into an individual 1 and 2. Running ft_itoa on
	 * each individual number. Since both numbers are a value less than 10 but
	 * greater than 0 we will convert them each into a string. So at this point
	 * we now have the strings "1\0", "2\0", and from our earlier call of 
	 * ft_itoa(123 % 10) we have the string "3\0". Since we have reached an end
	 * return point for our recursion we will be combining first the strings
	 * "1\0" and "2\0" inside the ft_strjoin function they are currently inside
	 * making them into the string "12\0". This brings us back up a level in 
	 * our recursion to now join "12\0" with the string "3\0" making the string
	 * "123\0". Since this has been placed now into our string str (NOTE: we
	 * have been allocating memory for each string on each call of ft_itoa in
	 * our recursion) we can return it now that the entire number has been
	 * converted into a char string. Thus ending our function. If this has been
	 * hard to picture in your head try walking the function through on a piece
	 * of paper. It should break down as sort of a binary tree.*/
